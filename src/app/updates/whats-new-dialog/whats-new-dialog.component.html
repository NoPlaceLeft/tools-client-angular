        <h2>People Groups Picker (deprecated)</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately we were not capturing people groups accurately.</p>
        <p>
            The People Groups selector has been removed. We apologize for the inconvenience and the loss of data.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will be coming out with a new People Groups selector soon, that is more accurate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having an accurate People Groups selector will allow us to contribute People Group Data to the People Groups
            Project API.

        <h2>New Date Picker</h2>
        <p>We have added a new date picker that will allow you to select the specific Year and Month.</p>
        <img src="assets/images/date-picker.png"
             width="100%">

        <p>
            The Original Date field has been deprecated, because the date format was incorrect and prevented us from
            creating accurate statistics.
        </p>

        <p>We ask that you go to each group, and select the proper date using the new date picker.</p>
        <p>Your original date will still be viewable. Once you pick the appropriate date, please click the red X button
            to remove the old date.</p>
